- Ported stuff to python
- PID control for angular stabilization
- direct PID control not possible for position control bc. no direct control authority
-- sequential PID control as in Quad-copter would be possible
--- Assumption that inner loop is fast does not hold in this case due to big rocket mass, low lateral control
--- Try sequential control with inner loop being the orientation (add very high gain as temp. fix), outer loop being the position
--- No respect wrt. to constraints possible
